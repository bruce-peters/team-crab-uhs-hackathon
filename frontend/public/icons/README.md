# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can generate these icons using tools like:
- https://favicon.io/
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Figma/Canva for custom designs

For now, the extension will work without these icons, but they should be added for a professional appearance.
